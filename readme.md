An OpenSource browser based Game, written in PHP

the goal of this Project is to provide a high quality OpenSource strategy browser game. 
Therefore we try to aim high code coverage and apply Clean Code Architecture.

The content of the src folder is Framework independent this allows us to switch the Framework to a better one in the future.
The src folder will be moved after development to its own repository while this repository will be the implementation to a Framework.

The Game is licenced under MIT
